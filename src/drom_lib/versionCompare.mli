(** Version comparison function used throughout. From the Dose suite. *)

(** Functions for manipulating and comparing Debian version strings. Compliant
    with Debian policy version 3.9.2. and Debian developers reference version
    3.4.6 *)

(** {2 Comparing debian version strings} *)

(** The following functions compare any two strings, that is these functions do
    not check whether the arguments are really legal debian versions. If the
    arguments are debian version strings, then the result is as required by
    debian policy. Note that two strings may be equivalent, that is denote the
    same debian version, even when they differ in syntax, as for instance
    "0:1.2.00" and "1.02-0". *)

(** @return
      [true] iff the two strings define the same version. Hence, the result may
      be true even when the two string differ syntactically. *)
val equal : string -> string -> bool

(** [compare x y] returns 0 if x is eqivalent to y, -1 if x is smaller than y,
    and 1 if x is greater than y. This is consistent with [Stdlib.compare]. *)
val compare : string -> string -> int

(** [a >= b] is a syntactic sugar for [compare a b >= 0]. *)
