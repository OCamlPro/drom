Use Cases
=========

This sections describes how the handle common use cases with :code:`drom`.


Using :code:`menhir`
--------------------

Whereas :code:`ocamlyacc` is the legacy parser generator for OCaml, 
:code:`menhir` is much more powerful and probably more prevalent nowadays.

For trivial usage where there is a simple :code:`parser.mly` file in your
package, setting::
  
  generators = ["menhir"]

into the corresponding :code:`package.toml` will likely work. However, if 
you have multiple :code:`.mly` files, or
need to specify custom :code:`menhir` flags, you'll probably need to tune
the :code:`dune` generation. A good way to properly do that is to disable
the default :code:`dune` generation for and add your own :code:`dune` stanzas
for parsing generators. First, add :code:`(using menhir X.Y)` in the 
:code:`drom.toml`'s ':code:`dune-project-header` field. For example::

  [fields]
  dune-project-header = "(using menhir 2.1)"

Then split your parsing code into at least two files :code:`tokens.mly` and
:code:`parser.mly`. The first one will contain the tokens definitions and the
second one the parsing rules. Doing this allows to parametrize the parser in
a modular fashion by using the :code:`%parameter <>` directive, if needed.
Then replace the :code:`generators = ["menhir"]` line by the following::

  generators = []

in :code:`package.toml` to disable the default :code:`dune` stanzas generation. 
Finally, add the following :code:`dune` stanzas to your 
:code:`dune-trailer` field::

  [fields]
  dune-trailer = """
  (menhir
    (modules tokens)
    (flags --only-tokens)
  )

  (menhir
    (modules tokens parser)
    (merge_into parser)
    (flags --external-tokens Tokens)
  )
  """

Of course, this is just a basic tuning and you can modify the flags or
targets as needed. The overall result will likely fit in most
of :code:`menhir` usages in :code:`drom` projects waiting for a better
:code:`menhir` support.
