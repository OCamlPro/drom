main.exe build
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Build a project



**DESCRIPTION**


This command performs the following actions:

* 1.
  Create a local opam switch. The argument **--switch SWITCH** can be used to make the local switch a link to a global switch. The argument **--local** can be used to force a local switch to be created.

* 2.
  Check that the OCaml version is at least the **min-edition** specified in the project. If OCaml is not installed, use the **--edition VERSION** argument or the **edition** field specified in the project to install OCaml.

* 3.
  Install all the dependencies in the opam switch. If the argument **--locked** was specified, use the **${package}-deps.opam.locked** file in the project to get exact dependencies.

* 4.
  Build the project by calling **opam exec -- dune build @install**

* 5.
  If build was ok, copy executable in the top directory of the project

main.exe dep (since version 0.2.1)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Manage dependency of a package



**DESCRIPTION**


Add, remove and modify dependencies from **drom.toml** and  **package.toml** files.

If the argument **--package** is not specified, the dependency is added project-wide (i.e. for all packages), updating the *drom.toml* file.

If the argument **--package** is provided, the dependency is added to the *package.toml* file for that particular package.

Dependencies can be added **--add**, removed **--remove** or just modified. The **--tool** argument should be used for tool dependencies, i.e. dependencies that are not linked to the library/program.

If no modification argument is provided, the dependency is printed in the terminal. Modification arguments are **--ver VERSION** for the version, **--lib LIBNAME** for the *dune* library name, **--doc BOOL** for documentation deps and **--test BOOL** for test deps.


**EXAMPLE**

::

  
  drom dep --package drom_lib --add ez_cmdliner --ver ">0.1"
  drom dep --package drom_lib --remove ez_cmdliner
  drom dep --add --tool odoc --ver ">1.0 <3.0" --doc true
  



**VERSION SPECIFICATION**


The version specified in the **--ver VERSION** argument should follow the following format:

* 1.
  Spaces are used to separate a conjunction of version constraints.

* 2.
  An empty string is equivalent to no version constraint.

* 3.
  Constraints are specified using a comparison operation directly followed by the version, like **>1.2** or **<=1.0**.

* 4.
  A semantic version like **1.2.3** is equivalent to the constraints  **>=1.2.3** and **<2.0.0**.

main.exe publish
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Update opam files with checksums and copy them to a local opam-repository for publication



**DESCRIPTION**


Before running this command, you should edit the file **$HOME/.config/drom/config** and set the value of the *opam-repo* option, like:
::

  
  [user]
  author = "John Doe <john.doe@ocaml.org>"
  github-organization = "ocaml"
  license = "LGPL2"
  copyright = "OCamlPro SAS & Origin Labs SAS"
  opam-repo = "/home/john/GIT/opam-repository"
  


Alternatively, you can run it with option **--opam-repo REPOSITORY**.

In both case, **REPOSITORY** should be the absolute path to the location of a local git-managed opam repository.

**drom publish** will perform the following actions:

* 1.
  Download the source archive corresponding to the current version

* 2.
  Compute the checksum of the archive

* 3.
  Copy updated opam files to the git-managed opam repository. During this operation, comment lines, :code:`version:` and :code:`name` lines are removed to conform to opam-repository policies.

Note that, prior to calling **drom publish**, you should update the opam-repository to the latest version of the **master** branch:
::

  git checkout master
  git pull ocaml master


Once the opam files have been added, you should push them to your local fork of opam-repository and create a merge request:
::

  cd ~/GIT/opam-repository
  git checkout -b z-$(date --iso)-new-package-version
  git add packages
  git commit -a -m "New version of my package"
  git push
  


To download the project source archive, **drom publish** will either use the *archive* URL of the drom.toml file, or the Github URL (if the *github-organization* is set in the project), assuming in this later case that the version starts with 'v' (like v1.0.0). Two substitutions are allowed in *archive*: *${version}* for the version, *${name}* for the package name.

**USAGE**
::
  
  main.exe publish [OPTIONS]

Where options are:


* :code:`-f` or :code:`--force`   Overwrite existing files

* :code:`--md5`   Use md5 instead of sha256 for checksums

* :code:`--opam-repo DIRECTORY`   Path to local git-managed opam-repository. The path should be absolute. Overwrites the value *opam-repo* from *$HOME/.config/drom/config*


main.exe run
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Execute the project



**DESCRIPTION**


This command performs the following actions:

* 1.
  Decrease verbosity level to display nothing during build

* 2.
  Build the project packages (see **drom build** for info).

* 3.
  Call **opam exec -- drun exec -- [PACKAGE] [ARGUMENTS]**, where **[PACKAGE]** is either the package name specified with the **-p PACKAGE** argument or the main package of the project if it is a program, **[ARGUMENTS]** are the arguments specified with **drom run**

* 2.
  If a file *scripts/before-sphinx.sh* exists, run it

* 3.
  Build Sphinx documentation using the command **sphinx-build sphinx _drom/docs/${sphinx-target}**, where **${sphinx-target}** is the **sphinx-target** field in the project description, or **sphinx** by default. Documentation source files are expected to be found in the top **sphinx/** directory.

Before using this option, you should make sure that dependencies are correctly installed on all of them, using the command drom build --switch SWITCH on every **SWITCH** in the list.
